# Joshua Lutz — Photography, Belief, and Contemplative Practice

## Photography as Persuasion (not Proof)
Photography is not the world; it’s a selection with a frame, vantage, time, and intention. It tempts us to believe it *proves* things. Following Errol Morris’ **Believing Is Seeing**, we inspect how captions, cropping, sequencing, and circulation manufacture belief. Ask: *What is the picture arguing? What is hidden by the frame? What labor and power stand behind this image?*

## Contemplative vs. Mindful Photography
- **Mindful photography**: practicing attention in the present moment—excellent, but incomplete.  
- **Contemplative photography**: attention + **Four Noble Truths** operationalized:
  1. Suffering/unsatisfactoriness appears (in ourselves, subjects, viewers, systems).
  2. Causes/conditions (clinging, aversion, ignorance; social conditions) underlie what we see.
  3. Relief is possible—images can reduce confusion, invite care.
  4. Path: practice aimed at **benefiting others**—ethics of representation, curiosity, and honest seeing.

## Working Questions
- What belief does this image ask me to adopt?  
- What is excluded by the frame?  
- How do caption, sequence, and platform steer interpretation?  
- What harm or help could this picture do? For whom?

## Short Practices (5–10 min)
- **Evidence/Argument**: Make three pictures of the same scene that ‘prove’ three different claims. Write one-sentence captions. Notice how belief shifts.  
- **Remove the Label**: Photograph an ordinary object as if you didn’t know its name. Avoid the “aboutness” and stay with color, light, and edges.  
- **Suffering/Care**: Make a series that acknowledges a small daily difficulty and one gesture of relief. One frame each.
